# Esthete

Esthete is a "frameworkless" PHP project skeleton that contains basic components such as http kernel, router, request dispatcher for a rapid web application development. It is mostly built on top of [Symfony Components](https://symfony.com/components).

All the codebase is placed under `App` namespace what gives you maximum flexibility to work around your custom cases.
